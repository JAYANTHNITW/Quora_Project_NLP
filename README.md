# Quora_Project_NLP
It is a kaggle competetion problem where we have to classifiy the given two questions are duplicate or not. in the given dataset there are only 4 columns. With these columns i have applied the basic preprocessing steps, then applied RandomForest and XGBoost algorithms. I got an accuracy of 68%. Then I have done the feature extraction and added 8 more features(like each question_length, common_words, each no. of words,,etc)  to the dataset. Then i got an accuray of 72 %. After seeing the top accuracy in kaggle leaderborad. I thought to perform advanced Feature extraction(like Fuzzy features) and added more 15 columns to the dataset. Finally got an accuracy of ~80%.
